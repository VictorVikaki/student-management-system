Student Management System
Project Overview
This project is a collaborative effort to build a simple, terminal-based Student Management System using C++. Our primary goal is:
Enhance C++ Skills: To collectively improve our C++ programming abilities by working on a practical application.
Master GitHub Workflow: To gain hands-on experience with fundamental GitHub concepts and best practices, including repository management, branching, committing, and pull requests.

What is the Student Management System?
The Student Management System is a straightforward console application designed to help manage student records. It will provide basic functionalities to interact with student data, 
making it a perfect learning ground for core C++ concepts like data structures, input/output operations, and basic file handling.

Key Features (Planned)
Add Student: Input and store new student records (e.g., Name, ID, Grade).
View Students: Display a list of all existing student records.
Edit Student: Modify the details of an existing student record.
Delete Student: Remove a student record from the system.
Search Student: Find a student record by ID or name.
